            An app for reading Fediverse archives, tested and compatible with Mastodon
            
            Developed as a public service by [ish.works](https://ish.works/)
            
            Fedi Archive is Open Source Software ‚Äî all of the code is in the public domain and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/dvorakroth/fedi-archive-tool). No information is sent anywhere by the app, and all archives are stored locally, as detailed in the [privacy policy](https://ish.works/fedi-archive-privacy.html).
            
            Making and publishing Fedi Archive (as well as keeping myself alive) requires effort and money, so if you found this app useful, it would be really cool if you could consider [leaving a tip](https://ko-fi.com/ish00). Thank you! ü§üüèª
            
            Fedi Archive uses plenty of open-source libraries, [listed here](fake://jkl/).
